# Multivariate COS Method for Basket Option Pricing

This repository presents a mathematical derivation and Python implementation of the **Multivariate COS method**, extending the approach of Fang & Oosterlee [1] and Ruijter & Oosterlee [2], and applying it to the pricing of **basket options**.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è This repository includes an original derivation of the **general multivariate COS coefficient formula** (Equation 10), not found in the referenced literature.

## üß≠ Project Overview

This project is split into two parts:

1. **Mathematical Derivation**
   - Formalizes the characteristic function for basket payoffs.
   - Generalizes the COS method to multivariate settings.
   - Derives COS coefficients using the characteristic function alone.
   - Applies the method to pricing a **put basket option**.

2. **Numerical Implementation** (coming soon)
   - Implements the multivariate COS method in Python.
   - Compares it against Monte Carlo simulation.

## üß† Solution Overview

![Approximation](Equation2.png)

This formula enables **efficient multidimensional density recovery** from the characteristic function.

### COS Pricing Formula

Using the COS approximation, we write the final pricing formula for the basket option as:

![COS Pricing](Equation3.png)

- \( F_k \): Fourier-Cosine coefficients from the characteristic function \( \phi(t) \)
- \( V_k \): Fourier-Cosine coefficients of the **payoff function**
